# flask-folium-app
By developing this app, we wished to accomplish the following:

1. Create a version 1 of an interactive well map with Folium. Possibility to add new features and functionalities to the map.

2. Gain experience with the full path from a Jupyter Notebook, to a Flask app, to deployment.

# Project description
The well data maps shows the position of all exploration wellbores on the Norwegian shelf. Wellbores are grouped into clusters when zooming out. By clicking on a wellbore position, a popup comes up with additional information.

Additionally, there is a contact form where users can contact us with comments/suggestions.

# Data
The dataset is in the form of a shapefile which is publicly hosted by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, [here.](https://www.npd.no/en/about-us/information-services/available-data/map-services/)

# Jupyter notebook to WebApp pipeline
Note: this pipeline is one of the many possibilities how to put a Jupyter notebook app into production. There are many other solutions.
