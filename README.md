# flask-folium-app
By developing this app, we wished to accomplish the following:

1. Create a version 1 of an interactive well map with Folium. Possibility to add new features and functionalities to the map.
2. Gain experience with the full path from a Jupyter Notebook, to a Flask app, to deployment.

# Project description
The well data maps shows the position of all exploration wellbores on the Norwegian shelf. Wellbores are grouped into clusters when zooming out. By clicking on a wellbore position, a popup comes up with additional information.
